Raspberry Pi in my car... 
Hello? I'm planning on installing a raspberry pi in my car with a 7-inch touch screen to replace the factory stereo. I'll use the stereo as the amplifier, but the interface will be the touchscreen. I had installed my google nexus 7, but I always has issues with charging it enough to kep it running. I gave up on that setup and went back to my factory stereo. I stream spotify so I would like to integrate that into my new system along with GPS, wifi, etc.
